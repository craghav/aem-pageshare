# Page Share (Preview)

AEM provides multiple options to preview content in AEM author, but a user would need a valid account to access the Author to preview the page. In few projects, all the members in the project team would not be setup in AEM which makes it hard to share the page for review/approval without activating the page. This projects try to solve this issue by creating a temporary link for the page , which can be access by any user without the need to login to AEM.

The Feature as been tested with AEM 6.4.8 and AEM core components 2.9.0.

## Modules

The main parts of the template are:

* core: Java bundle containing all core functionality like OSGi services, listeners or schedulers, as well as component-related Java code such as servlets or request filters.
* ui.apps: contains the /apps (and /etc) parts of the project, ie JS&CSS clientlibs, components, templates, runmode specific configs as well as Hobbes-tests
* ui.content: contains read access to service user.

## How to build

To build all the modules run in the project root directory the following command with Maven 3:

    mvn clean install

If you have a running AEM instance you can build and package the whole project and deploy into AEM with  

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage
    
Or to deploy it to a publish instance, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackagePublish
    
Or alternatively

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage -Daem.port=4503

Or to deploy only the bundle to the author, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallBundle
